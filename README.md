### Overview

This project is my solution to the
Frontend Mentor – Product List with Cart Challenge
.
The goal of this challenge is to build an interactive product interface where users can add items to a cart, adjust quantities, view a confirmation modal, and start a new order — all with clean UI and a smooth user experience.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### My process

### Built with

Semantic HTML5

CSS Custom Properties

Flexbox & CSS Grid

Mobile-First Workflow

Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)

Dynamic DOM manipulation

Custom event listeners

Toast notifications

Responsive image handling

###  What I Learned

This project strengthened several Vanilla JS concepts:

Building a complete cart system without frameworks

Handling nested event listeners

Efficient DOM manipulation

Creating dynamic UI components from JS

Building toast notifications manually

Managing UI state (buttons, borders, modal)

Responsive images using JavaScript

### Continued Development

During this project, I noticed a few areas I still want to improve:

Becoming more confident with advanced JavaScript patterns

Writing cleaner and more modular code

Improving accessibility and keyboard interactions

Adding smoother animations and transitions

These are skills I want to strengthen in future projects.
